IMAGE_PROMPT_GUIDELINES=(
"""
Objective: Create detailed and comprehensive prompts for image generation models that ensure high-quality, visually appealing images suitable for social media posts.
Prompt MUST include (but not limited to) the following elements:
- Camera angle: Specify the camera angle (e.g., aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, low-angle shot).
- Subject: Describe the main subject of the image (e.g., a person, animal, object) in high detail.
- Context: Provide background or context for the subject (e.g., a cityscape, nature scene, indoor setting).
- Action: Describe what the subject is doing (e.g., walking, running, turning their head).
- Style: Specify the artistic style (e.g., cartoon, realistic, abstract) or reference specific film styles (e.g., horror film, film noir).
- Composition: Describe how the shot is framed (e.g., wide shot, close-up, extreme close-up).
- Ambiance: Describe the color and light in the scene (e.g., blue tones, night, warm tones).
- Additional details: Include any specific features like colors, sizes, or other specifications that should not be changed.
- Optional elements: Consider adding details about lighting, mood, or specific visual effects that enhance the image.
- Ensure that the prompt is comprehensive and covers all relevant aspects of the image to be generated.
- Avoid vague or generic descriptions; instead, use specific adjectives and phrases that paint a clear picture of the desired image.
- If the prompt is for a series of images, ensure that each prompt is unique and tailored to the specific image while maintaining consistency in style and theme.
- If the prompt is for a character or recurring theme, ensure that the description is consistent with previous images but allows for creative variations.
- Use clear and concise language to ensure the prompt is easily understood by the image generation model.

STORY_TEXT_GUIDELINES=(
"""
Objective: Create engaging, standalone stories for TikTok posts that captivate the audience without implying or requiring follow-up content or raising false expectations about future updates.

Craft Self-Contained Stories:
Every storyline must have a clear beginning, middle, and end within a single post.
Avoid open-ended conclusions or cliffhangers (e.g., "To be continued," "What happens next?") that suggest additional content.
Ensure the narrative resolves its core conflict or theme, leaving no loose ends that imply a sequel.
Example: Instead of "She found a mysterious key in the attic... what does it unlock?" use "She found a mysterious key in the attic, which opened a chest filled with her grandmother's old love letters, revealing a heartwarming family secret."

Set Clear Expectations:
Avoid language that hints at future updates, such as “Stay tuned,” “More to come,” or “Find out soon.”
If the post is part of a themed series, clarify that each post is independent. For example: “Another standalone tale from our [Series Name] collection!”
If referencing a broader universe or recurring characters, ensure the specific storyline is complete and doesn't rely on prior or future posts for context.

Focus on Emotional or Thematic Closure:
Design stories to deliver a satisfying emotional or thematic payoff (e.g., humor, inspiration, surprise) within the post's constraints.
Use concise narratives that evoke a complete experience, such as a moment of triumph, a funny anecdote, or a poignant reflection.
Example: A post about a character overcoming self-doubt to win a race should end with their victory and a brief reflection, not a hint at a future race.

Avoid Overpromising or Speculative Elements:
Do not include promises of rewards, outcomes, or events that cannot be delivered within the post (e.g., “This character's journey will change everything” without showing the change).
Avoid speculative questions or prompts that invite the audience to expect answers later (e.g., “What do you think will happen?”).
Ensure any call-to-action (e.g., “Share your thoughts!”) focuses on engagement with the current story, not anticipation of more content.

Adhere to Platform Constraints:
Tailor the storyline length to the platform's limits (e.g., 280 characters for X posts, longer for Instagram captions).
Use concise language to ensure the entire story fits within a single post, avoiding the need for threads or multi-part posts unless explicitly requested.
If a thread is used, ensure the thread itself is a complete story, not a teaser for future posts.

Incorporate Brand Consistency Without Dependency:
If the storyline ties to a brand or campaign, reflect its tone, values, or themes, but don't rely on external context (e.g., prior posts, website lore) to make the story understandable.
Ensure the post stands alone for new viewers while resonating with existing followers.

Test for Clarity and Completeness:
Before finalizing a storyline, evaluate whether it could be interpreted as requiring follow-up content. Ask:
Does the story resolve its main plot or question?
Could a reader reasonably expect more content based on the wording or structure?
Is the tone conclusive, or does it feel like a teaser?
If any answer suggests ambiguity, revise to ensure closure.
Examples of Acceptable vs. Unacceptable Storylines:
Acceptable: “Jake, a shy barista, finally mustered the courage to ask out his crush. She said yes, and they shared a coffee under the stars, laughing about their mutual nerves.” (Complete, satisfying, no follow-up implied.)
Unacceptable: “Jake, a shy barista, found a note from his crush. What does it say? Stay tuned!” (Cliffhanger, implies more content.)

Handle Audience Engagement Carefully:
Encourage interaction (e.g., likes, comments, shares) by inviting reactions to the story itself, not speculation about future developments.
Example: Instead of “What should happen next?”, use “What's your favorite moment in this story?”

Review for False Expectations:
Avoid exaggerated claims or promises within the story (e.g., “This discovery will change the world!”) unless the resolution is shown in the post.
If the story involves a product or service, ensure claims align with reality and don't overpromise outcomes beyond what's depicted.
